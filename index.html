          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Toshinori Yagi (八木俊典), also known as All Might (オールマイト), is the former No.1 Pro Hero who bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace (平和の象徴). He teaches Foundational Hero Studies at U.A. High School.

         All Might was the eighth holder of the One For All Quirk after receiving it from Nana Shimura. He has since passed the torch to Izuku Midoriya, whom he is training to be his successor. After using up all the embers of One For All to defeat All For One, All Might retired and ended his era as the world's greatest hero.</p>

          <h2>Appearance</h2>
          <p>Toshinori in his empowered form is a large, muscular man with chiseled features and a strong jawline. He has short blond hair, swept backwards, with two tufts sticking up above his head. His face is shadowed, except for his bright blue eyes. His hero costume consists of a skintight blue bodysuit with a red "Y" symbol and a white diamond in the center. There are white lines connected to the symbol that trace from his chest to his back shoulders, and the symbol appears to have wings on the sides. He wears a gold belt with a silver buckle and red eyes, forearm sleeves in gold with blue accents and spiked fins, and shin-length gold boots trimmed with white and red accents.

In his true form, after sustaining permanent damage, Toshinori is a skinny man with sharp, angular features and long limbs. He has a large scar covering most of his left chest and may spout blood from his mouth when excited or surprised. He typically wears baggy clothing to accommodate the change in body mass, but later on, he wears clothes that fit his true form. In his early career, Toshinori was a lean but fit young man with softer facial features. Both in his normal and empowered form, his eyes show his white sclerae and deep blue irises.</p>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Personality</h2>
          <p>All Might's hero persona is influenced by comic book superhero stereotypes, characterized by his exuberance, dramatic flair, and dedication to protecting and saving innocent people with a smile. His mentor, Nana Shimura, ingrained in him the belief that those who smile are the strongest. Despite occasional annoyance, All Might is friendly and amicable, taking the time to interact with his fans due to his popularity and years in the spotlight.

When All Might reverts to his true form, he becomes reserved and solemn, avoiding attention and contrasting the grandiosity of his hero identity. While optimistic, he remains grounded in reality and advises others, like Quirkless Izuku, to consider more realistic professions. All Might frequently vomits blood due to his fragile health, but his optimistic and oafish nature remains consistent across both forms.

His lifelong goal has been to become a pillar of hope that people can rely upon during tough times. With the power of One For All, All Might became not only a hero but a legendary figure, inspiring the world and striking fear into villains. He consistently prioritizes saving as many people as possible, sometimes neglecting other hero duties. After his battle with All For One, he hides his weakened state to maintain public morale. However, the injuries take a toll on him, and his smile becomes a facade to hide his fears and insecurities. Izuku's brave actions reignite All Might's heroic spirit and remind him of the principles of heroism.</p>

          <h2>Abilities</h2>
          <p>Overall Abilities: While officially earning the rank of the Number 1 hero of Japan, All Might was also well-recognized as the greatest hero in the world. He was the "Symbol of Peace" and such a deterrent against crime that villains were largely discouraged by his presence in society, single-handedly bringing near-absolute stability throughout Japan, a stark contrast to the rest of the world. He was able to defeat All For One, infamously known as the world's most powerful villain, twice; a feat that all the previous wielders of One For All could not. Despite winning however, All Might suffered a gruesome injury at the hands of All For One that limited his maximum power output going forward, gradually reducing his sheer might and how long he could use his power at all.</p>

          <h2>Equipment</h2>
          <p>High Density Weights (Final Exams Arc): All Might and the rest of the teachers use these bracelets to give themselves a handicap while they are fighting their students.

Air Pressure Shooting Torso Armor: At one point, All Might wore armor over his torso that was designed to aid him in releasing shots of pressurized air. It was designed to work with 20-30% of his power. Due to All Might's close-range fighting style, the bulky armor ended up being more baggage than it was worth, and it kept breaking, so All Might decided to stop using it.

Hercules: During the Dark Hero Arc, All Might begins driving a heavily armoured car known as Hercules, which has been shown to be able to survive a point blank grenade explosion with minimal damage. Later, during the Final War Arc, as All Might prepares to face All For One once more, this car, alongside the briefcase All Might has been carrying since he obtained Hercules, can break apart, appearing to form themselves around his body.</p>

          <h2>Trivia</h2>
          <p>Some of All Might's early designs had him as an older, more experienced figure. He also had less of a role in the story, being just a veteran hero who would encourage the main character to try to become a hero even if he didn't have a Quirk, instead of a recurring mentor figure.
All Might's preliminary designs were also deemed "lame" by Horikoshi's editors, prompting him to make All Might more imposing and slightly younger-looking.
All Might's real name contains the kanji for "eight" (八 ya?), "tree" (木 gi?), "genius" (俊 toshi?) and "law" (典 nori?).
According to All Might's Volume 1 profile:
His favorite things are movies and the cedars from Yakushima.
Drawing a frontal shot of All Might is extremely taxing to Kohei Horikoshi, likely due to the excessive amount of shading present in his design.
In his true form, All Might's glistering pupils are meant to represent his strength and purity when his muscle form isn't active.
His catchphrase "I am here" (Dub: "A Phone Call is Here!") is his phone's ringtone.
The same thing goes for his email, which has a notification sound of "An email is here!".
All Might's hero agency is located somewhere in Roppongi in Minato, Tokyo.
During his time as a hero, the true details of All Might’s Quirk were kept secret, to the point where it was one of the world’s greatest mysteries. Whenever asked about it in interviews, he would simply joke and dodge the question.</p>

          <p>"It's fine now. Why? Because I am here!"<br>
"I smile to show the pressure of heroes and to trick the fear inside of me.<br>
"I cannot simply say 'you can become a hero even without power.<br>
"I really am pathetic. Even though I admonished you, I wasn't putting what I said into practice! Pros are always risking their lives!"<br>
"You can become a hero!"<br>
"You're next."<br>
(To All For One) "You must remember the endless warring that got us here... and now I hear that Tomura Shigaraki's hatred is even affecting your original body... so I'm thinking... you won't be able to ignore me. Isn't that right? I... am here.</p>
